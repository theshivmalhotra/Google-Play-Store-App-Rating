## General Information
Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app. For which, you can ask questions like:

* Does a higher size or price of an app necessarily mean that it would perform better than the other apps? 
* Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?

We will be using data visualisation to answer these questions and derive corresponding insights. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
